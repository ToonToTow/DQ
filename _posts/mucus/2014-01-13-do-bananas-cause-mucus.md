Great for smoothies, healthy, tasty and nutritious but it seems that everytime you eat bananas, your body produces more-than-needed mucus. Could bananas be causing the issue? The answer is ... maybe? Read below to find if you are!

## Mucus
Mucus is an important substance of your body, it traps germs and foreign particles in your respiratory passages that could harm you. Your body produes more mucus than normally when you have a cold, asthma, cough or any other respiratory condition.

## Histamine liberators
Let's talk about histamine. Histamine is a substance that helps your body fight allergies. Although bananas do not contain histamine, they are considered "histamine liberators", they push your body to create more, resulting in excessive mucus.

## Allergies
Most people are not allergic to bananas, but you could be. It often isn't obvious if you are allergic to a food but if you find yourself consistently over-producing mucus when eating bananas, make a note of it and discuss it with your doctor.

## Throat disorders
It is possible that bananas might not be the cause. Viral infections, laryngitis, cararrh sinusitis, cigarette smoke, polluted air could be other causes.

## How to deal with it?
You could stop eating the fruit if you feel you are allergic to it. You could try eating mucus-destroying foods like honey or drinking chamomie tea or gargling hot water.
