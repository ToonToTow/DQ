Feeling like a wave of sadness hits you after eating happens to lots of people. Different people have different reasons and responses. Here are some reasons that may resonate or help explain why this happens.

## Eating unhealthy
One possible reason could be the type of food that you eat. Quality and the type of food you eat has a big correlation on how you feel afterwards. Foods high in sugar, greasy, hight-fat, fried foods may taste good and feel good in the moment of eating but they have a big impact on you and how your body regulares glucose. Be mindful of what you eat and limit such foods like sodas, french fries or high-fat foods.

## Stress eating
Stress-eating, your brain "telling" you to eat even though you may not be feeling hungry is a fairly common coping mechanism in emotionally difficult times.If you feel such a way you could try meditating or eating a piece of carrot, celery, fruit or drinking a glass of water.

## Guilty eating
Eating food to avoid or supress a difficult or unpleasant emotion but once you have eaten, your mental state did not improve, in fact it worsened with the addition of guilt that you ate and it solved nothing, especially if you ate something particulary unhealthy. This creates a vicious loop with stress causing overeating causing stress and so on. Try to be concious while eating. When your brain "wants" a food, try meditating, drinking a glass of water or setting yourself a goal such us "I'll eat after I do this".

## Reactive Hypoglycemia
Reactive hypoglycemia is when you experience low blood sugar after eating. This drop in blood sugar happens usually after an increase in insulin production and it can make you feel anxious, sad, annoyed and sometimes confused. Try consuming less caffeine, alcohol and unhealthy foods. Try eating a more balanced diet for a few weeks while also keep track of what you eat on a meal tracker. If symptoms continue, it is highly recommended to contact your doctor. Reactive hypoglycemia tends to have underlying medical conditions.
