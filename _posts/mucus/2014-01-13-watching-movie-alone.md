Watching a movie in a cinema alone might be quite daunting and anxiety enducing for a lot of people. This goes especially for younger people who feel that they need to fit in or be conforming to what is "cool".

## Is it weird to go to a movie alone?
It is not weird at all to go the movies alone. Lots of people have done it, do it and will continue doing it. A better question would be do YOU want to go watch a movie. If yes then GO. It's your life, enjoy it while it lasts. Donâ€™t let others opinions stop you from being happy.

## Advantages of going alone
There's even some advantages of going alone!
You can see any movie you want!
Sit anywhere you like!
You want food? go for it, no worries!
No need to plan ahead, you can live in the moment!
The only disadvantage is the wanting to talk about it after the movie ends. Worry not, online discussion boards are always there ðŸ˜‚
