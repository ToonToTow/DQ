## Cough
There is no scientific evidence that tomatoes improve cough but they are good if you have a cold.

## Cold
Tomatoes contain vitamin C and carotenoid which aid the immune system, prevent common cold and reduce its duration and severity.

# Soup
You can turn the tomatoes into a delicious tomato soup. Tomato soup helps sore throats by reducing mucus production for a few hours.
